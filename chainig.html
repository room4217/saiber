Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text 
of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
 five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
 typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
 in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
 Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
 like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
